Purchase Order Management System
This is a robust and efficient Purchase Order Management System meticulously crafted with Java, employing sophisticated Object-Oriented principles. 
This Java application, built with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) techniques, offers a range of functionalities, including:
Login Access: The system provides three types of access rights: Sales Manager, Purchase Manager, and Administrator.
User Registration: Administrators can register users and maintain unique identification numbers for each user, categorizing them as SM, PM, or Admin. User details are stored in a text file.
Item Entry: Sales Managers can add, save, delete, and edit item details.
Supplier Entry: Sales Managers can manage supplier information, including addition, deletion, and editing.
Daily Item-wise Sales Entry: Sales Managers can record daily sales data for individual items.
Create a Purchase Requisition (PR): Sales Managers can initiate Purchase Requisitions.
Display Requisition: Sales Managers and Purchase Managers can view PRs.
Generate Purchase Order (PO): Purchase Managers can create, save, delete, and edit Purchase Orders.
List of Purchase Orders: Sales Managers and Purchase Managers can view a list of Purchase Orders.

The system is designed to be menu-driven, and users can interact with it via the provided options. The menu repeats until the user chooses to exit the system. The application leverages OOP principles to identify relationships between entities and to develop the necessary methods for meeting the system's requirements.
